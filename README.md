# Chuan's Functional Safety Project of a Lane Assistance System



My job here is to create functional safety documents based on what I learned in the lessons. These documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.
